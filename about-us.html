        <h2>What is Insulation Rats Co.?</h2>
        <h4>Insulation Rats was founded in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland in 1643. We have since expanded to a global franchise, with branches all around the world! Starting off as a simple grain company, we have expanded to cover many different products! But at Insulation Rats Co., we want to give back to the community. Since 2001, we have begun to open schools that cover many different skills! Some of these schools include the Insulation Rats Dance School, the Insulation Rats Angling Academy, and the Insulation Rats College of Cooking! We have a very friendly and proper workplace, with only 200 lawsuits this year! We are constantly hiring, so please send your applications to:
1537 Paper St., Wilmington, DE 19886</h4>
	     <h2>What is the goal of Insulation Rats?</h2>
	     <h4>The only goal of Insulation Rats Co. is to create a better world. Using our cutting-edge deforestation and fracking machines, we collected the resources necessary to produce our high-quality products that you know and love, from the Rat-hole Automatic Rear-Wiper, to the new Insul-box Sub-zero Fridge! Many radical eco-terrorists have claimed that our resource collection is dangerous, and that we are destroying the world, but do you really want to believe terrorists? Insulation Rats offers nothing but the safest mining machines, giving our child workers the best working conditions while they help us give you the household appliances you need! </h4>
